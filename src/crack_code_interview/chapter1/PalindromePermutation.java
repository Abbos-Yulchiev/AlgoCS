    Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palin-
    drome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation
    is a rea rrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
