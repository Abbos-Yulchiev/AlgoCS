    We say that a string contains the word hackerrank if a subsequence of its characters spell the word
    hackerrank. For example, if string  it does contain hackerrank, but  does not. In the second case,
    the second r is missing. If we reorder the first string as , it no longer contains the subsequence
    due to ordering.
